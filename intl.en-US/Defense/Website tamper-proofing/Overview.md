# Overview {#concept_m4q_tc3_dhb .concept}

To enable illegal profit-making activities or business attacks, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in websites to insert illegal hidden links or deface webpages. Webpage defacement affects normal user access and may lead to serious economic losses, damaged brand reputation, or political risks.

Webpage defacement prevention is a value-added service provided by Security Center. This service monitors website directories in real time and backs up and restores tampered files or directories. This service prevents drive-by downloads, hidden links, and the uploading of inciting and illicit content.

Users of Security Center **Pro Edition** and **Enterprise Edition** can activate webpage defacement prevention.

Security Center Basic Edition does not support webpage defacement prevention. A user of Security Center Basic Edition must upgrade to Pro Edition or Enterprise Edition to activate the service.
