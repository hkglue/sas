# Purchase licenses {#task285 .task}

One Web Tamper Protection license is required to enable protection for each server.

In the upper-right corner of the Tamper Protection page, you can view the total number of licenses, the number of license used, and the license expiration date.

If the number of servers to be protected is larger than that of available licenses, you will receive a message indicating that **Failed to add. Please check whether there is sufficient authorization quota currently!**. In this case, you need to purchase more Web Tamper Protection licenses.
