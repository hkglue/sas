# Renewal and upgrade {#concept_qq3_dcc_zdb .concept}

If you are using Advanced or Enterprise Edition of Security Center, we recommend that you renew your Security Center subscription before its expiration date to ensure the availability of the service. If the number of assets under your account is 120% of the number of assets configured for your current subscription, you must upgrade your subscription by specifying the larger number of assets and pay the additional fees to continue with your current subscription.

## Expiration {#section_ryq_dcc_zdb .section}

One week before your Security Center subscription expires, Security Center sends you a message reminding you to renew your subscription. If you do not renew your subscription before it expires, your assets are no longer protected by Security Center starting from the first day after the expiration date.

For three days after the expiration date, Security Center retains all your configurations and data, such as your asset groups, tags, quarantined files, vulnerability whitelist, baseline check policies and baseline check whitelist, and asset fingerprints. You must renew your Security Center subscription within the three days to retain your configurations and data.

If you do not renew your subscription within three days of your Security Center subscription expiration date, your Security Center configurations and data are removed. You must purchase a new Security Center Advanced or Enterprise Edition subscription to resume use of Security Center.

    **Note:** You cannot change the number of assets to be protected by Security Center during a subscription renewal.

4.  Click **Pay Now** and complete payment.

## Upgrade {#section_syq_dcc_zdb .section}

When upgrading your Security Center subscription, you must specify at least the actual number of billable assets, that is, the total number of ECS instances and external servers under your account. You cannot specify a number that is less than that. If you predict that the number of billable assets may increase within the validity period of your subscription, you must specify the predicted number of servers you will need Security Center to protect as your total number of assets.

During the subscription period of your Security Center Enterprise Edition, if the number of servers under your account is more than 120% of the number of assets configured for your current subscription, the system notifies you of an upgrade required to your Security Center subscription. If this occurs, you must upgrade your Security Center subscription to continue using the service.

For example, if the number of assets configured for your Security Center Enterprise Edition subscription is 10, but you now have 13 servers under your account, you must configure the number of assets as 13 and pay the additional fees generated for the three extra servers to continue using Security Center.
