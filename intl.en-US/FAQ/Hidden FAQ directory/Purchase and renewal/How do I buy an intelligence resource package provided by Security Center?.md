# How do I buy an intelligence resource package provided by Security Center? {#concept_djn_t1c_b2b .concept}

An intelligence resource package allows you to call the API operation for a certain number of times.

**Note:** If you receive an error code for an operation, the number of available operation calls is not reduced.

After you buy a new resource package, the number of available operation calls increases, and the service expiration postpones for one year.

You can buy intelligence resource packages on the [purchase page of Security Center](https://common-buy.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.8836940.769558.1.6BKmEl&commodityCode=sas_ip#/buy). An intelligence resource package contains a minimum of 500 million operations.
