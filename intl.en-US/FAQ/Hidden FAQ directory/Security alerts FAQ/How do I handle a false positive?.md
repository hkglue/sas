If Security Center regards a normal process or activity as a threat and sends you alerts on it, you can **Whitelist** to prevent further alerts on this event.

Find the alert on the alert list, and click **Processing **and choose **Whitelist**. The alert status is changed to **Handled**.

**Note:** If you still receive alerts on an event that has been added the whitelist, the related normal process may have been infected with viruses. We recommend that you check all the alerts on the server affected by this alert to eliminate other potential risks and security threats. If an alert persists after you add the whitelist multiple times, submit a ticket for support.
