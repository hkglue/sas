You can handle two types of alerts by the quarantine operation. After you confirm that an alert is not a false positive, find it in the Security Center console. Click **Processing** in the **Actions** column to quarantine the malicious process and webshell files.

The two alert types are as follows:

-   Malicious process-DDoS trojans

-   Webshells

All the other alerts have to be handled offline on your servers. You can view the **solution** for each alert on the alert details page.
