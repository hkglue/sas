Security Center allows you to use the quarantine operation to handle certain types of alerts online.

## Which types of alerts can be handled by the quarantine operation? {#section_24z_2h1_sn8 .section}

You can handle two types of alerts by the quarantine operation. After you confirm that an alert is not a false positive, find it in the Security Center console. Click **Quarantine** in the **Actions** column to quarantine the malicious process and webshell files.

The two alert types are as follows:

-   Malicious process-DDoS trojans
-   Webshells

All the other alerts have to be handled offline on your servers. You can view the **solution** for each alert on the alert details page.

## Where can I view the quarantined files? {#section_eaw_0lb_7tr .section}

In the left pane of the Security Center console, choose **Alerts** \> **Quarantine**.
