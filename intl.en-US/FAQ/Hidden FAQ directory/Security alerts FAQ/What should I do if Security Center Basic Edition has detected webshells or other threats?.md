# What should I do if Security Center Basic Edition has detected webshells or other threats? {#concept_521470 .concept}

Security Center provides Basic Edition \(Free Edition\), Pro Edition, and Enterprise Edition. Basic Edition does not provide protection against malicious processes, webshells, or suspicious processes. Therefore, you cannot view the alert events.

Basic Edition only provides features such as unusual logon detection, vulnerability detection, and cloud platform configuration check. On the **Alerts** page in the Security Center console, only the **unusual logon detection** feature is enabled.

If a Basic Edition user receives alerts on threats such as webshells, viruses, and trojans, the user must **upgrade** Security Center to Pro Edition or Enterprise Edition to view and handle the alerts. For more information on upgrade, see [Renewal and upgrade](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Renewal and upgrade.md#).

**Note:** To try Security Center Enterprise Edition, go to the [Product details page](https://www.aliyun.com/product/sas) of Security Center, and click **Free Trial**.
