# How do I find the webshell detection feature in Security Center? {#concept_525287 .concept}

After you upgrade Server Guard Enterprise Edition to Security Center, you can still use features such as webshell detection and unusual logon detection.

On the Alerts page in the Security Center console, click the **alert type** drop-down list, and select Webshell or Unusual Logon to view and handle the corresponding alerts.
