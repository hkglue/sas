# Vulnerability detection cycle {#concept_ncy_gr1_1hb .concept}

Security Center detects and fixes vulnerabilities including Linux software vulnerabilities, Windows vulnerabilities, Web CMS vulnerabilities, and urgent vulnerabilities.

Security Center automatically scans for Linux software vulnerabilities, Windows vulnerabilities, and Web CMS vulnerabilities **once every other day**. Manual operations are required to detect urgent vulnerabilities.

Security Center also automatically detects other vulnerabilities, such as those in software configuration and system components.

You can view and handle the detected vulnerabilities on the Vulnerabilities page in the Security Center console.

For more information about vulnerability detection, see [Vulnerability management settings and whitelist configuration](../../../../intl.en-US/Precautions/Vulnerabilities/Vulnerability management settings and whitelist configuration.md#).
