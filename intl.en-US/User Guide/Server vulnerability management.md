# Server vulnerability management {#concept_rfr_mzc_zdb .concept}

Threat Detection Service provides server vulnerability management to automatically detect system vulnerabilities on your servers. This article introduces how to use server vulnerability management.

## Function description {#section_jkt_bgk_zdb .section}

Server vulnerability management helps you detect and fix the following system vulnerabilities on servers:

-   **Web content management system \(WCMS\) vulnerabilities**

    TDS uses vulnerability patch databases in the cloud to provide automatic vulnerability detection and quick vulnerability repair as follows:

    -   TDS automatically detects vulnerabilities, reports detection results, and sends alerts.
    -   TDS allows you to easily fix vulnerabilities by replacing common web files \(MD5 checksum validated\).
    -   TDS also allows you to verify vulnerability fixes. You can also use the undo fix function to restore the web files that have been replaced by TDS.
-   **Vulnerabilities of Linux software**

    TDS scans the software that has been installed on your servers against the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures \(CVE\) list to discover matching vulnerabilities in your software and send alerts. TDS also provides commands for you to fix vulnerabilities that have been detected and allows you to verify these vulnerability fixes.

-   **Windows vulnerabilities**

    TDS automatically checks if your servers have the latest Microsoft updates installed, and sends alerts if it finds any vulnerabilities. TDS also can automatically detect and fix major vulnerabilities on your servers.


## View and fix vulnerabilities {#section_mkt_bgk_zdb .section}

Follow these steps to view and fix vulnerabilities that have been detected in the operating system \(Linux or Windows\) and WCMS of your servers:

1.  Log on to the [Threat Detection Service console](partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/sas).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Vulnerabilities**.
3.  Go to the Server Vulnerabilities page to view all server vulnerabilities.
4.  You can use the vulnerability search and tag functions to quickly find a vulnerability. For example: 
    -   Search for a vulnerability by name.
    -   Select vulnerability tags to quickly search for a vulnerability. For example, you can select the **Unhandled**, **Urgent**, and **WCMS Vulnerabilities** tags to search for a critical WCMS vulnerability that needs to be fixed urgently.
5.  Perform the following actions according to your needs:
    -   To disable TDS alerts for a specific vulnerability, select the vulnerability, and then click **Ignore** under the vulnerability list.
    -   To exclude a specific vulnerability from the vulnerability detection list, select the vulnerability, and click **Add to Whitelist** under the vulnerability list. TDS does not detect vulnerabilities in the whitelist.
6.  Click a vulnerability name to go to the vulnerability details page. You can view detailed vulnerability information and affected assets on this page.
7.  Select an action to manage a vulnerability, depending on the type of the vulnerability.

    **Note:** 

    -   You can select an action in the **Actions** column to manage an affected server. You can also select multiple affected servers, and then select an action to manage the selected servers.
    -   To manage multiple vulnerabilities, use the batch management tool in the upper-right corner of the **Affected Assets** page. Enter a batch name, and click **Save** to create a batch to fix all vulnerabilities that have been filtered out. You can then track the relevant servers and verify vulnerability fixes by specifying the batch name.
    -   **Linux software vulnerabilities**
        -   You can click **Fix** to directly fix a vulnerability. You can also click **Generate Fix Command** to automatically generate a command, log on to the relevant server, and then run the command to fix the vulnerability. 

            **Note:** If a vulnerability fix requires a server restart to take effect, you must not restart the server until the **Status** of the vulnerability changes to **Fixed \(To Be Restarted\)**, and then restart the server and click **Restarted and Verified**.

        -   You can click **Ignore** to ignore a vulnerability. The system will no longer alert you for this vulnerability.
        -   You can click **Verify** to verify the vulnerability fix. If you do not perform a manual verification, the system will automatically perform a verification 48 hours after the vulnerability fix procedure has completed.
    -   **Windows system vulnerabilities**
        -   You can click **Fix** to fix a vulnerability. The system caches an official Windows patch in the cloud for your server to download and update. 

            **Note:** If a vulnerability fix requires a server restart to take effect, you must not restart the server until the **Status** of the vulnerability changes to **Fixed \(To Be Restarted\)**, and then restart the server and click **Restarted and Verified**.

        -   You can click **Ignore** to disable TDS from alerting you for a specific vulnerability.
        -   If your server has been installed with a vulnerability patch, you can click **Verify** to verify the vulnerability fix.
    -   **WCMS vulnerabilities**
        -   You can click **Fix** to fix a WCMS vulnerability by replacing the web files that contain the vulnerability on your server. 

            **Note:** Before you fix a WCMS vulnerability, we recommend that you back up the relevant web files. You can reference the path in the vulnerability management instructions to back up the web files.

        -   You can click **Ignore** to ignore a vulnerability. The system will no longer alert you for this vulnerability.
        -   You can click **Verify** to verify a vulnerability fix. If you do not perform a manual verification, the system will automatically perform a verification 48 hours after the vulnerability fix procedure has completed.
        -   For vulnerabilities that have been fixed, you can click **Undo Fix** to restore the web files that have been replaced by TDS.

## Vulnerability management settings {#section_ykt_bgk_zdb .section}

The vulnerability management settings allow you to enable or disable automatic detection for different types of vulnerabilities, select a server for application vulnerability detection, set a time window to remove invalid vulnerabilities, and configure the vulnerability whitelist.

You can click Add to Whitelist under the vulnerability list to add multiple vulnerabilities to the whitelist \(see [View and fix vulnerabilities step 5](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Server vulnerability management.md#ul_rdz_btz_22b)\). After the vulnerabilities have been added to the whitelist, the system no longer detects these vulnerabilities. The vulnerability management settings allow you to maintain the vulnerability whitelist.

Follow these steps to perform vulnerability management settings:

1.  Log on to the [Threat Detection Service console](partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/sas).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Vulnerabilities**.
3.  Click **Settings** on the Server Vulnerabilities page.
4.  You can perform the following tasks on this page:
    -   You can select a vulnerability type, and click the toggle to enable or disable detection for the specified vulnerability type.
    -   You can select a vulnerability type, and click **Manage** to specify servers on which TDS detects the specified vulnerability.
    -   You can set a time window to remove invalid vulnerabilities: 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days. 

        **Note:** If you do not take any action on the detected vulnerabilities, the system determines that the alert settings for the vulnerabilities are invalid. The system removes the vulnerabilities when the specified period expires.

    -   You can select vulnerabilities in the whitelist, and click **Remove** to enable TDS to detect these vulnerabilities and send alerts.
