# Vulnerability management settings and whitelist configuration {#concept_en4_btc_ygb .concept}

The **vulnerability management settings** allow you to enable or disable automatic detection for different types of vulnerabilities. It also allows you to enable vulnerability detection on specific servers, set a time period for keeping invalid vulnerabilities, and configure a vulnerability whitelist.

You can select multiple vulnerabilities from the list of Linux software vulnerabilities, Windows system vulnerabilities, and Web-CMS vulnerabilities, and whitelist the selected vulnerabilities. Security Center does not detect a whitelisted vulnerability. You can manage the vulnerability whitelist in the vulnerability management settings.

## Procedure {#section_ykt_bgk_zdb .section}

1.  Log on to the [Security Center console](http://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/sas).
2.  Choose **Precaution** \> **Vulnerabilities** \> **Settings**.
3.  On the displayed Settings page, you can perform the following operations:
    -   Click the toggle on the right of a vulnerability type to enable or disable vulnerability detection.
    -   Click **Manage** to add servers for vulnerability detection.
    -   Set the time period for keeping invalid vulnerabilities to 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days.

        **Note:** If you do not take any action on a detected vulnerability, the system determines that the alert on this vulnerability is invalid. The system automatically removes this vulnerability after the specified period.

    -   In **Vul Whitelist**, select a vulnerability, and click **Remove** to enable vulnerability detection and alerting.
